Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid UI development using predefined classes. It pairs beautifully with Astro's component-based approach.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS enables you to build modern interfaces by composing utility classes directly in your HTML or component files. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use classes like `text-center`, `bg-gray-100`, or `px-4`.

## Installation in Astro

First, install Tailwind CSS in your Astro project using the official integration.

### Step 1 â€” Install the integration

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss astro-tailwind
